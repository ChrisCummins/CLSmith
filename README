More information about discussions and where to post bug reports to come.

The OpenCL C part of the generator is largely kept in its own part, leaving
csmith as intact as possible (with some modifications made to allow CLSmith to
inject functionctionality into csmith or to pass control to CLSmith). Keeping
csmith and CLSmith separate turned out to be very tricky and probably not worth
the effort.

Both CLSmith and cl_launcher can be built with the included CMake files:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build . --config Release -- -j 8

This generates the CLSmith and cl_launcher executables inside the build directory.
